These columns cover various aspects related to power consumption, voltage, and sub-metering categories.

**Data Type:**
The dataset is structured as a Pandas DataFrame, a tabular data structure commonly used in Python for data analysis.

**RangeIndex:**
The DataFrame's RangeIndex spans from 0 to 2,075,259, providing a unique label for each row in the dataset. This index is useful for referencing and accessing specific rows.

**Column Information:**
The DataFrame comprises nine columns with distinct data types:

- **Global_active_power (float64):** This column contains numerical values, specifically representing active power consumption.
- **Date, Time, Global_reactive_power, Voltage, Global_intensity, Sub_metering_1, Sub_metering_2, Sub_metering_3 (object):** These columns are of data type object, implying they likely contain categorical or text-based data. The interpretation of these columns will depend on the specific data they hold.

**Missing Values:**
Several columns in the dataset have missing values, as indicated by "Non-Null Count" values being less than the total number of entries (2,075,259). The extent and locations of missing data vary across columns, requiring attention during data preprocessing.

This detailed understanding sets the stage for further exploration, cleaning, and analysis of the dataset based on the specific objectives of your project.

## 6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Time Series Decomposition:

üìà The time series decomposition applied to the hourly global active power data serves as a valuable technique for unveiling underlying patterns in the dataset. This process dissects the data into three components: trend, seasonal patterns, and residual variations. Understanding these components is crucial for gaining insights into how power consumption evolves over time. Stakeholders can use this information to anticipate trends, identify recurring seasonal patterns, and recognize unexpected variations that may warrant further investigation.

### Heatmap of Hourly Power Consumption:

üî• The heatmap visualizes the hourly power consumption across different days, providing a comprehensive overview of consumption patterns. Businesses can leverage this visualization to identify specific hours or days characterized by consistently high or low power consumption. Such insights are instrumental in optimizing operational schedules. For instance, identifying periods of low consumption may present opportunities for scheduling maintenance or energy-intensive tasks. This knowledge also facilitates resource allocation, enabling businesses to adjust staffing levels, equipment usage, or energy-intensive processes based on expected power demand during different hours.

### Violin Plot of Hourly Global Active Power:

üéª The violin plot offers a nuanced view of the distribution and variability of power usage throughout the day. Stakeholders can gain a holistic understanding of how power consumption fluctuates over different times, aiding in the improvement of energy efficiency and resource management. The violin plot is a powerful tool for making informed decisions related to energy use patterns. By visualizing the spread and density of power consumption, stakeholders can identify peak periods, assess variability, and implement strategies to enhance overall energy sustainability.

## 7. Modelling

In the process of estimating future energy use for your individual electricity dataset, you have employed a variety of predictive models. The goal is to identify the model that performs optimally in providing reliable estimates. Below is an explanation of the different models considered in your modeling phase:

1. **Baseline Models:**
   - Average Consumption Forecasting:
     This baseline involves predicting future energy consumption by using the average consumption from historical data. It provides a simple and intuitive starting point for comparison.
   - Historical Averages:
     Another baseline approach is to use historical averages directly as predictions. This assumes that future consumption will follow the patterns observed in the historical data.

2. **Linear Regression:**
   - **Description:**
     Linear regression is a straightforward model that seeks linear patterns in the data. It's a fundamental approach that can capture basic relationships between input features and energy consumption.
   - **Application:**
     We employed linear regression to analyze your data and capture any linear trends that may exist in the electricity consumption patterns.

3. **Deep Neural Networks:**
   - **Description:**
     üß† Deep neural networks, including dense networks, are capable of capturing intricate correlations in the data. These models can automatically learn complex relationships.
   - **Application:**
     A Sequential model has been used to construct deep neural networks. The model architecture includes dense layers, allowing it to learn hierarchical representations of the input data.

4. **Specialized Models:**
   - **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:**
     LSTMs are designed for sequential data and can capture long-term dependencies. These networks are suitable for time-series data like energy consumption.
   - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):**
     üîÑ CNNs excel at recognizing spatial patterns in data. They have been applied to capture spatial dependencies in your electricity dataset.
   - **CNN-LSTM Hybrid:**
     Combining the strengths of CNNs and LSTMs, this hybrid model is capable of capturing both spatial and sequential patterns.
   - **Autoregressive LSTM:**
     An LSTM model that learns from its own predictions, allowing it to iteratively improve its understanding of the data.

5. **Evaluation Metric:**
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**
     The primary metric for evaluating model performance is the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the test set. MAE measures how close predictions are to the actual consumption values, providing a clear indicator of prediction accuracy.

6. **Model Training:**
   - **Optimization:**
     The Adam optimizer has been employed for model training, adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the chosen loss function.
   - **Loss Function:**
     Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used as the loss function. It quantifies the difference between predicted and actual values during training.
   - **Early Stopping:**
     ‚è≠Ô∏è Early stopping is implemented as a callback during training. It halts training when the model's performance on the validation set ceases to improve, preventing overfitting.

## 8. Conclusion

üèÜ After thorough evaluation, the AR-LSTM model emerged as the best-performing, boasting the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) among all models. This model showcases its prowess in predicting future household power consumption, marking a significant stride toward a more efficient and sustainable energy future.

Let the magic of predictive analytics illuminate every home, sparking a revolution in energy efficiency and transforming the way we power our lives! üå†
