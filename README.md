## 5. Data Understanding
Column Names:
The dataset comprises the following columns:

Date
Time
Global_active_power
Global_reactive_power
Voltage
Global_intensity
Sub_metering_1
Sub_metering_2
Sub_metering_3
Each column's name suggests the type of information it holds, such as power consumption, voltage, and sub-metering details.

Data Type:
The dataset is structured as a Pandas DataFrame.

RangeIndex:
The DataFrame has a RangeIndex starting from 0 and extending to 2,075,259. This index provides unique labels to each row in the dataset.

Column Information:
The DataFrame consists of 9 columns with varying data types:

One column, Global_active_power, is of data type float64, suggesting it contains numerical values.
Eight columns, Date, Time, Global_reactive_power, Voltage, Global_intensity, Sub_metering_1, Sub_metering_2, and Sub_metering_3, are of data type object. These likely contain categorical or text-based data.
Missing Values:
Several columns exhibit missing values. The "Non-Null Count" values for each column are less than the total number of entries (2,075,259). The extent of missing data varies across columns.

   - [Provide insights gained from EDA, visualizations, and key findings.]

## 8. Modelling
   In the process of estimating future energy use for your individual electricity dataset, you have employed a variety of predictive models. The goal is to identify the model that performs optimally in providing reliable estimates. Below is an explanation of the different models considered in your modeling phase:

1. Baseline Models:
Average Consumption Forecasting:

This baseline involves predicting future energy consumption by using the average consumption from historical data. It provides a simple and intuitive starting point for comparison.
Historical Averages:

Another baseline approach is to use historical averages directly as predictions. This assumes that future consumption will follow the patterns observed in the historical data.
2. Linear Regression:
Description:

Linear regression is a straightforward model that seeks linear patterns in the data. It's a fundamental approach that can capture basic relationships between input features and energy consumption.
Application:

You've employed linear regression to analyze your data and capture any linear trends that may exist in the electricity consumption patterns.
3. Deep Neural Networks:
Description:

Deep neural networks, including dense networks, are capable of capturing intricate correlations in the data. These models can automatically learn complex relationships.
Application:

A Sequential model has been used to construct deep neural networks. The model architecture includes dense layers, allowing it to learn hierarchical representations of the input data.
4. Specialized Models:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:

LSTMs are designed for sequential data and can capture long-term dependencies. These networks are suitable for time-series data like energy consumption.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):

CNNs excel at recognizing spatial patterns in data. They have been applied to capture spatial dependencies in your electricity dataset.
CNN-LSTM Hybrid:

Combining the strengths of CNNs and LSTMs, this hybrid model is capable of capturing both spatial and sequential patterns.
Autoregressive LSTM:

An LSTM model that learns from its own predictions, allowing it to iteratively improve its understanding of the data.
5. Evaluation Metric:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
The primary metric for evaluating model performance is the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the test set. MAE measures how close predictions are to the actual consumption values, providing a clear indicator of prediction accuracy.

6. Model Training:
Optimization:

The Adam optimizer has been employed for model training, adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the chosen loss function.
Loss Function:

Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used as the loss function. It quantifies the difference between predicted and actual values during training.
Early Stopping:

Early stopping is implemented as a callback during training. It halts training when the model's performance on the validation set ceases to improve, preventing overfitting.

## 9. Conclusion
   - After thorough evaluation, the AR-LSTM model emerged as the best-performing, boasting the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) among all models. This model showcases its prowess in predicting future household power consumption, marking a significant stride toward a more efficient and sustainable energy future.

Let the magic of predictive analytics illuminate every home, sparking a revolution in energy efficiency and transforming the way we power our lives! ðŸŒ
